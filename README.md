<img width="1280" height="720" alt="App_Logoo" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12e059f0-416a-4336-aaa3-150d34621742" />

CaGS-AP is a machine-learning powered platform for predicting the inhibitory activity of small molecules against **_Candida albicans_ β-1,3-glucan synthase (CaGS)** — a clinically validated antifungal drug target.

This tool enables **virtual screening, hit-prioritization, and activity confidence assessment** using an ensemble of optimized machine-learning classifiers.

## 📌 Application Overview

CaGS-AP allows users to:

✔ Upload chemical datasets (SMILES format)  
✔ Predict CaGS inhibitory activity  
✔ Compute model-consensus probability  
✔ Rank hits automatically  
✔ Assess prediction confidence  
✔ Perform scaffold-level SAR analysis  
✔ Save publication-ready plots & reports  

The tool is implemented in **Python + Streamlit**, supporting both **batch screening** and **single-molecule prediction** modes.
